1.Among students who have registered for some section, find the ones who have the
maximum number of COURSE REGISTRATION (Caution: course registration is not section
registration. For example, if student Susan’s only registered for course ‘Programming
Theory’ in 2 different sections, then the number of COURSE REGISTRATION is 1, while the
number of section registration is 2). For each student as such, information displayed
should involve:

+ Identifier of student (i.e. the primary key for student)
+ Name of student
+ Number of COURSE REGISTRATION

```sql
with take_num(id,take_num)as
(
	select id,count(course_id) from takes
	group by id
)
select student.id,name,take_num from student join take_num on student.id=take_num.id
where take_num=(select max(take_num) from take_num)
```

    </div>
</center>

2.USE outer join to construct the following query
For all instructors, display the amount of work and salary information. The instructors
who have never taught any courses should also be considered. For each instructor,
information displayed should involve:

+ Identifier of instructor (i.e. the primary key for instructor)
+ Name of instructor
+ Salary of instructor
+ Number of courses taught by the instructor (Caution: The number here is not the number of sections which have been taught. E.g., instructor A have taught the course B twice in 2 sections, the number of course that have been taught is 1). For those instructors who have never taught courses, the number should be set to 0.
+ Number of sections taught by the instructor

```sql
select instructor.id,instructor.name,salary,count(distinct course_id)as 'course_num',count(sec_id)as sec_num from instructor left join teaches on instructor.id=teaches.id
group by instructor.id,name,salary
```

<center>
    <div class="photoset-grid-custom" data-layout="213">
        <img src="/images/2016-11-19/4-2.jpg">
    </div>
</center>

3.USE scalar subquery in select clause to construct the following query Find information for each course in the course table. Courses which have never been offered (that is, the courses have no corresponding rows in section table) or registered by any student should also be considered. For each course, information displayed should involve:

+ Identifier of course (i.e. the primary key for course)
+ Name of course
+ Total Number of students who have registered for the course
+ Number of sections for the course

```sql
--select distinct course_id,sec_id from takes where course_id='cn1'
with course_info(course_id,sec_num,stu_num)as
(
	select course_id,count(distinct sec_id),count(id)
	from takes group by course_id
)
select course.course_id,title,stu_num,sec_num
from course left join course_info on course.course_id=course_info.course_id
```

<center>
    <div class="photoset-grid-custom" data-layout="213">
        <img src="/images/2016-11-19/4-3.jpg">
    </div>
</center>

果然过了几年SQL上机还是要改题目的（。

4.Find students who have registered for some but not all courses taught by instructors of department '拳脚学院'. Do this using the "not exists ... except ..." structure. For each student as such, information displayed should involve:

+ Identifier of student(i.e. the primary key for student)
+ Name of the student
+ Number of courses, taught by instructors of department '拳脚学院', registered by the student

```sql
select student.id,student.name,count(distinct takes.course_id) as course_num
from student join takes on student.id=takes.id
join teaches on takes.course_id=teaches.course_id
--and takes.sec_id=teaches.sec_id
join instructor on teaches.id=instructor.id
where instructor.dept_name='拳脚学院' and student.id not in
(
	select id from student s where not exists
	(
		select course_id from course 
		where course.dept_name='拳脚学院'
		except
		select T.course_id from takes as T
		where T.id=s.id
	)
)
group by student.id,student.name
```

<center>
    <div class="photoset-grid-custom" data-layout="213">
        <img src="/images/2016-11-19/4-4.jpg">
    </div>
</center>

5.As query requirement in Q4, Use matching of counts to fulfill the requirement. (don't
forget the distinct clause!).

```sql
select student.id,student.name,count(distinct takes.course_id) as course_num
from student join takes on student.id=takes.id
join teaches on takes.course_id=teaches.course_id
and takes.sec_id=teaches.sec_id
join instructor on teaches.id=instructor.id
where instructor.dept_name='拳脚学院'
group by student.id,student.name
having count(distinct takes.course_id)<(select count(course_id) from teaches join instructor on instructor.id=teaches.id where instructor.dept_name='拳脚学院')
```

本题结果应当同4，但是我在本地却不一样。（4运行出来了一个元组，而5没有）
