Eternal rains will come
We should say goodbye
And suffer on our own
As all our thoughts were wrong

***So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through***
***And when the flood comes to drown us***
***There is nothing we can do***

You told me not to wait
Unless I could wait forever
Because there is no time for us
Take comfort in what was

***So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through***
***And when the flood comes to drown us***
***There is nothing we can do***

Here it comes, our death comes
And in my sleep I can't forget

***Reaching for the surface, I see you***
