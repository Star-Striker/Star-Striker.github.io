Eternal rains will come

We should say goodbye

And suffer on our own

As all our thoughts were wrong



***So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through***

***And when the flood comes to drown us***

***There is nothing we can do***



You told me not to wait

Unless I could wait forever

Because there is no time for us

Take comfort in what was



***So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through***

***And when the flood comes to drown us***

***There is nothing we can do***



Here it comes, our death comes

And in my sleep I can't forget

***Reaching for the surface, I see you***
