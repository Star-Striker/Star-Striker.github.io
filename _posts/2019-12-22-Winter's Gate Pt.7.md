The flames is weak and frail

A circle of shiverin men

Enclosed by endless coldness

The evernight, eternal dark

The moan of undying winds

Now merged with hollow screaming

The fire dies in a sngle breath

The end has come

Out of the darkness, out of the cold

Out of the night, they have come

Cruel is the laughter, cruel is the fate

Cruel is the winter's will



Merciless is the fray

Bitter the final stand

Perdition and ruin;

The icy grip now traps them

Right here at the world's end

The forst of death will take them all

The lords of the high seas

Are smitten down into snow

No way to bear the fury

No way to ward off all the fiends

Devouring the sun and the earth

Devouring the forest and sea

Devouring us all

Sing a quiet song to me

Sing of spring and sing of sea

Sing a silent song to me

Sing of hope and sing of sleep
