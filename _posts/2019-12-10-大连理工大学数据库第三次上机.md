1.Insert  every  student  who  has  never  registered  for  any  course  as  an  instructor  in the same department, with salary=40000

```sql
insert into instructor select id,name,dept_name,40000 from student where tot_cred=0;
select * from instructor
```

给出的答案截图：

        <img src="/images/2016-11-19/3-1.jpg">
    </div>
</center>

2.Now delete all the newly added "instructors" above (note: already existing students who happened to have salary=40000 should not get deleted)

```sql
delete from instructor where id = (select id from student where tot_cred=0);
select * from instructor
```

<center>
    <div class="photoset-grid-custom" data-layout="213">
        <img src="/images/2016-11-19/3-2.jpg">
    </div>
</center>

3.Update  the  salary  of  each  instructor  with  addition  of  1120  times  the  credits  they have taught(Note: for example, one instructor teaches some course which has 3 credit twice,  then  the  instructor  should  get  additional  1120*6  dollars,  besides  his  original salary)（提示:可以使用with语句先计算出老师教课的学分）

```sql
with tot(addi,id) as (select sum(credits),id from course join teaches on course.course_id=teaches.course_id group by id)
	select distinct name,salary=1120*(addi)+salary from instructor join tot on instructor.id=tot.id;
```

其实我觉得用update写也行。

4.Grades are mapped to a grade point as follows: A:10, A+:10.5,A-:9.5, B+ 8.5,B:8, B-:7.5 ,C+:6.5 ,C:6, C-:5.5, D+:4.5,D:4,D-:3.5 and F:0. Write a query to find the average grade point of each student. Make sure students who have not got a non-null grade in any course are displayed with an average grade point of null. Information displayed should involve:

#Identifier of student

#Name of student

#Count of course registered by the student

#Average grade point

（提示:1.在select 中可以使用case 语句;2.参照表的外连接）

```sql
select distinct student.id,name,count(course_id) as co_course,avg(
	case grade
	when 'A+' then 10.5
	when 'A' then 10
	when 'A-' then 9.5
	when 'B+' then 8.5
	when 'B' then 8
	when 'B-' then 7.5
	when 'C+' then 6.5
	when 'C' then 6
	when 'C-' then 5.5
	when 'D+' then 4.5
	when 'D' then 4
	when 'D-' then 3.5
	when 'F' then 0
	else null
	end
)as avg_point
from student left join takes on student.id=takes.id group by student.id,name;
```

5.Find all rooms that have been assigned to more than one section at the same time. Display the rooms along with the assigned sections; I suggest you use a with clause or a view to simplify this query.

（提示:from 中的子查询，也可以用with 语句代替from 中的子查询）

```sql
with room(building, room,year,semester,time_slot,times)
as(select building,room_number,year,semester,time_slot_id,count(*) from section
group by building,room_number,year,semester,time_slot_id having count(*)>1)
select s1.building,s1.room_number,s1.course_id,s1.sec_id,s1.semester,s1.year,s1.time_slot_id from section s1 join room on s1.building=room.building
and s1.semester=room.semester and s1.year=room.year
and s1.time_slot_id=room.time_slot
```
